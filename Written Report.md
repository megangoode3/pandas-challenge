Summary of Analyis
The analysis consisted of determining the possible correlation between student grades and overall passing rates with various school compenents such as types of schools, spending, total students, etc.
15 schools made up the analysis, with 39,170 students within those schools.  Types of schools included charter and district, with almost equal sets of each school type, but double the amount of students in the district schools versus charter schools.
Reading and Math were the two subjects for grading scores and passing percentages.

Findings
The per student budget was relatively the same for each of the schools, regardless of type with a small range of $578-$655 per student.
The total school budget did not seem to have an affect on the passing rates.  Two of the bottom performing schools had budgets over $2.5m, while the top performers budgets were average of only $1m. Overall passing was the hightest in the lowest student budget and the lowest with the highest student budget.
Average grades by age/level of grade stayed about the same at each school level.
The most determing factor seems to be school size; large schools with over 2,000 students the overall passing score was only 56%, about 35% percent lower than the 90% passing on small and medium schools
